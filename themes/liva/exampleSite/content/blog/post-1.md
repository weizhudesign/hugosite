Many villages in China have economic backwardness due
to historical and location reasons, but they well preserve the
style of traditional villages. The China Foundation for Poverty
Alleviation has leveraged its rich experience in township construction
to set up a “Baimei Village” project to help the development
of China’s remote and impoverished mountain
villages and to take the road of rural revitalization. In order
to let more people understand this charity project, the China
Foundation for Poverty Alleviation held the first China Public
Welfare Illustration Competition under the brand “Baimei Village”.
