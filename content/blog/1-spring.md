> **Many** villages in China have economic backwardness due to historical and location reasons, but
they well preserve the style of traditional villages. The China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation has leveraged its rich experience in township constructionto set up a “Baimei Village” project to help the development of China’s remote and impoverished mountain villages and to take the road of rural revitalization. 

>  In order to let more people understand this charity project, the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation held the first China Public Welfare Illustration Competition under the brand “Baimei Village”.
